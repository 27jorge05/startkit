# EEG Foundation Challenge Start Kits

This repository contains start kits for the [EEG Foundation challenges](https://eeg2025.github.io), a NeurIPS 2025 competition focused on advancing EEG decoding through cross-task transfer learning and psychopathology prediction.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Challenge 1: Cross-Task Transfer Learning

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Challenge 1 start-kit"/>
</a>

**Goal:** Develop models that can effectively transfer knowledge from passive EEG tasks to active cognitive tasks.

### Challenge 2: Predicting the P-factor from EEG

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Challenge 2 start-kit"/>
</a>

**Goal:** Predict the psychopathology factor (P-factor) from EEG recordings to enable objective mental health assessments.

## ü§ù Community & Support

This is a community competition with a strong open-source foundation. If you see something that doesn't work or could be improved:

1. **Please be kind** - we're all working together
2. Open an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/eeg2025/startkit/issues)
3. Join our weekly support sessions (starting 08/09/2025)

The entire decoding community will only go further when we stop solving the same problems over and over again, and start working together!
