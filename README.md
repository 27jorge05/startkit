# EEG Foundation Challenge Start-kits

This repository contains start-kits for the [EEG Foundation challenges](https://eeg2025.github.io).

This is a community competition with a strong open-source foundation.
So, if you see something that does not work or could be improved, first, **please be kind**, and we will fix it together on github. It all starts in the [*issues*](https://github.com/eeg2025/startkit/issues) tab, with a discussion :)

The entire decoding community will only go further when we stopped solving the same problems over and over again, and it starts working together!
